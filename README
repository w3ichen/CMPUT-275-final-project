Final Project : Fitness Tracking Device

Names: Gurbani Baweja, Steven Jiao, Tyler Mah, Weichen Qiu
ID(s): 1590254,<insert steven's ID>,<insert tyler's id>, 1578205

Included Files:
- README
- Makefile
- main.cpp
- cpp_server folder
      - Makefile (for desktop)
      - serialport.h
      - serialport.cpp
      - server.cpp
- Wire folder (Arduino Library)
      - Wire.h
      - Wire.cpp
      - twi.h
      - twi.c

Running Instructions:
  1. Copy "Wire" folder to "/Home/arduino-ua/libraries/"
  2. Type "make upload" into terminal
  3. Navigate to "server" folder and type "make", then type "./server"

Accessories:
      - Arduino
      - TFT Touch Screen
      - GY-521 Module (accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature)
      - Breadboard
      - Wires

Wiring instructions:
  1. Connect a pin to SCL and SDA pins (top-right), then attach touch screen
  2. Connect Vcc and GND of GY-521 to 5V and GND respectively
  3. Connect SCL of module to arduino and SDA to SDA

Notes and Assumptions:
  **It is crucial to copy Wire folder to arduino libraries
  - Server files syncs arduino to PC time and date. 
      - Typing "./server" will repeatedly resync to the time

CODING NOTES vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
Step 1:
- User interface on the touchscreen with the following buttons:
      i. [DONE] temperature icon that updates ~10 seconds
      ii. [DONE] Current time and date at top (if possible) probably gets time/date from computer at upload
      iii. [DONE] Start workout button
      iv. End workout button
      v. View realtime graph
- Use gyroscope to turn screen off to save power when device is not facing up (prob find voltage pin to display and digitwrite it to off??)

Step 2:
- When start workout is pressed:
      i. Use a data structure to store acceleration data
      ii. Display time elapsed in realtime (prob using milis())
      iii. Button to view realtime plot of acceleration data

Step 3:
Here is where most of algorithms is used to analyze recorded data in a meaningful way
- When end workout is pressed:
      i. Show time elapsed
      ii. (?) use sort algorithm to find time of most activity (highest acceleration) (?)
** analyze data using algorithms in a meaningful way**
maybe comparing to previous workouts to see if they improved.


_____________________________________
OTHER NOTES:
- plz use meausrements() function to get measurements
- plz update currentMode as you change to different modes
___________________
!!note Arduino desktop IDE has a plotting called "serial plotter"
"https://learn.adafruit.com/experimenters-guide-for-metro/circ08-using%20the%20arduino%20serial%20plotter"
Useful for visualizing acceleration data!!
ex. 
Serial.print(GyX);Serial.print(" ");
Serial.print(GyY);Serial.print(" ");
Serial.println(GyZ);
will plot 3 lines of GyX, GyY and GyZ
